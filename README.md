# Generative-AI_Nutrition-App

* This is a Streamlit application named “Gemini Health” that uses the Google Generative AI model “gemini-pro-vision” to analyze food items from an uploaded image and calculate their total calorie content.
* The application allows users to upload an image of food items. Once the image is uploaded, the user can click on the “Tell me about total calories” button to get information about the total calories in the food items present in the image.
* The Google Generative AI model takes as input a prompt and the uploaded image, and returns a text response. The prompt instructs the model to identify the food items in the image, calculate the total calories, provide details of each food item with its calorie intake, and finally mention whether the food is healthy or not, along with the percentage of macro and micro nutrients.
* The application displays the response from the model on the Streamlit interface.
* Please note that you need to have the Google API key set in your environment variables to use the Google Generative AI model.
* This application can be a useful tool for individuals tracking their calorie intake or for those who are interested in understanding the nutritional content of their meals.
